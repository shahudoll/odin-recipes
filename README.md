html practice

This is my first html practice project and here I am sure to tell this is going to be recipe website boilerplate where
I will be laying out the structure of displaying a recipe using html only and the elements I'll be going to use would consist of the 
DOCTYPE  declaration then I would start the html tag within it I am going to include the head tag and the body tag 

within the head tag I am including the UTF-charset 8 to set the characterset declaration and then add the title of the recipe webpage 
using the title tag 

then in the body tag I am going to use a heading mostly h1 for including the content header as the "Odin-Recipes" and I am thinking to add 
recipe of a soap using the p tag to add the paragraph decription of how to make the soap recipe and then I will use the ol and ul (ordered list/unorderedlist) tag to include the ingredient list and the steps to follow to make the recipe a success 

I would also use the img a void tag to add some lucrative soap making images as to give some idea and also a decorative piece on my webpage.
using relative links .
